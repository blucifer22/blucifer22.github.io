Howdy!

If you're reading this, either I've managed to hold your attention for more than the femto-second I'd anticipated or the SEO is finally doing its \*\*\*\*ing job. Either way, introductions are in order! :smile:

A bit about myself, I'm a Third-Year Electrical Computer Engineering and Computer Science Undergrad at Duke University. I originally hail from ***SCENIC*** Central Pennsylvania but I currently reside in equally ***SCENIC***, and admittedly, more sparsely populated, Southern Delaware. On-campus, I am the Student Manager for the Innovation Co-Lab Studio, Associate Chief Justice of Duke Student Government Judiciary, serve on the exec board for Club Krav Maga, and when I’m otherwise not in class (and when class isn’t remote!) you can usually find me hanging around the Izatt Lab working on some cool OCT projects. In my free time, I hack hardware, develop console emulators, build random things in Rust, and generally try to avoid electrocuting myself! Some of my more...*social*...hobbies include trail running, geocaching, playing the guitar/ukulele (poorly), building replica Star Wars armor (Reppin' the Shoretrooper fam!), and GMing tabletop RPGs.

The purpose of this site is triplicate:

- To chronicle my (mis)adventures in the Engineer-O-Sphere(TM)
- To showcase some cool projects, FOSS, and other stuff I've been monkeying on
- Provide my fellow gifted primates with tutorials, advice[^1], and other thought-germs I've picked up along the way

Formalities aside, this page is designed to give a bit of a window into what us engineering folks actually *do*. (Read: I'm not ALWAYS a code monkey![^2]) Hopefully it accomplishes this goal. If not, I'm gonna assume the secondary objectives of *"chronicling the increasingly depraved rants of an Electrical Engineering student"* and *"occasionally being mistaken for that other famous guy with the -ski last name"* will near-certainly have been met. :wink:

Welp, that's all for now. This is definitely a living document, so check back for updates soon-ish?
Until next time...

Go slow amigos,

Marc
